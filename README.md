# Full-Flask-Backend

An implementation of flask app that comes with:

-   modular (means it uses blueprint), so this code has very low-cost to maintain
-   carefully setting up the database ORM model in order to have the desired relationships (based on ERD graph), such as many to many, one to many, and one to one
-   pay very strict attention human errors, such as implementing triggers in order to address human errors at the server-level
-   there is a png file inside /database which is an ERD graph of the implemented database
-   I do also provide the old-main file which is the implementation of this project without using framework (not-modular)
